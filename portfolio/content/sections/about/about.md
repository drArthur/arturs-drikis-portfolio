I have always been passionate about creating elegant, efficient systems. Be it Lego during childhood, people,
code and processes now or even essential oils in perfumes during my free time. I love putting things together
to make the whole more than the sum of each part.

I particularly enjoy the human aspect of collaborative coding work, project management, pragmatic approaches
to coding.

People say that I am an engaging, reliable, energetic, upbeat, optimistic and yet pragmatic person, with a knack
for developing junior members of staff.

High performance is always on the top of my mind: I was awarded with a “Stand-out Employee of the Year
2022” when I have led (and in large part written) code changes that are saving £200'000 in lost revenue each
week.
